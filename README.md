# Deep-Learning-Based-Ocular-Disease-Detection-Using-Fundus-Images

Ocular diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma (GL), and Cataract (CA) significantly affect vision and overall quality of life. This project proposes a deep learning-based multi-class classification system for fundus image analysis using a curated subset of the Eye Classification (ODIR) Dataset.

### Our approach enhances traditional image preprocessing by combining:

Wavelet Transform for multi-resolution feature extraction

Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for improved contrast

Blood Vessel Segmentation for vascular structure clarity

### These enhanced images are then classified using two deep learning models:

VGG-19 for deep spatial feature learning

ConvNeXt for hierarchical feature extraction
